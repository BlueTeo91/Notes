### FixedTerms_DL.m
1. The building entry loss are not considered, is it correct? Apparently it's not in the equation for path loss in 38.821 for NTN calibration but it is considered in 38.811
2. Are the constant parameters from ITU and all the constant in files: **gamo.m**, **gamw.m**, **gfun.m**, **ITU676.m**... ok?

### UseCaseConfiguration.m
1. Correction of factor 100 for LOS probability in lines 756-759. *SYSTEM.LOSprobability(:,2)* used also in **Shadowing.m**

### GetDLbudget.m
1. Not taking into accoutn for cable loss (in 38.821 eq. 6.1.3-5 we have Lc)
2. Is the coupling loss right?
